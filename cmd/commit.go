	Use:   "commit",
	Short: "A brief description of your command",
	Long: `A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains examples
and usage of using your command. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.`,

		gitIndex.Init()
		// Step 1: Read the index file
		gitIndex.Deserialize()

		// Step 2: Read the HEAD file
		head := &core.GitHead{}
		head.Init()

		// If the commit hash was found, create the parent commit object

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// commitCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// commitCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
